# DataAnalytic - MateCart

This repository was created as part of my Coderhouse course.  
Using **Power BI** and an **Excel dataset**, I developed *MateCart*, a fictional eCommerce business focused on yerba mate products.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- `data/dataset.xlsx` â†’ Raw dataset used for analysis  
- `dashboards/MateCart.pbix` â†’ Power BI dashboard file  
- `reports/MateCart.pdf` â†’ Exported report with key insights  

## ðŸ”Ž Project Description
The goal of this project was to practice data cleaning, modeling, and visualization using Power BI.  
Key insights include:

- Customer behavior patterns  
- Revenue trends and growth opportunities  

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Download the Excel dataset to explore the raw data.  
2. Open `MateCart.pbix` in **Power BI Desktop** to interact with the dashboard.
